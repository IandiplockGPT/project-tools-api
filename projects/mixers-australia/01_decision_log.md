|-----|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| D-001 | 2026-02-02 | Use staged, cell-based automation approach (Area A/B/C) | Reduces risk, allows fast-tracking and parallel engineering | Defines overall plant architecture and scope structure | Mexx (Ian Diplock) | Approved |
| D-002 | 2026-02-02 | Use MIG welding process as baseline | Aligns with client preference and current manufacturing process | Drives welding package selection and WPS development | Mixers Australia / Mexx | Approved |
| D-003 | 2026-02-02 | Do not reference third-party benchmark projects in client-facing outputs | Confidentiality and commercial sensitivity | Documentation control requirement for all deliverables | Mexx | Approved |
| D-004 | 2026-02-02 | Treat bowl as 3 major sections (front/middle/rear) for manufacturing flow | Matches current product structure and enables modular production | Drives fixture strategy and material flow design | Mixers Australia / Mexx | Approved |
| D-005 | 2026-02-02 | Target throughput basis: up to 5 bowls/day (assume 16 hrs/day) | Sets performance requirement and takt time | May require parallel cells / multi-station layout | Mixers Australia / Mexx | Assumed (Confirm) |
| D-006 | 2026-02-02 | Use separate internal reference file for benchmarks | Prevent leakage into proposals | File structure standardised | Mexx | Approved |
