## Core Rule (Hard Constraint)
The project consists of **THREE DISTINCT AUTOMATED MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS**.

These systems are:
- NOT process steps
- NOT optional
- NOT merged
- NOT reinterpreted as generic factory stages

Each system is a **standalone automation cell** with its own:
- fixturing
- robotics
- welding process
- material handling interfaces

---

## System A — Final Assembly Circumferential Welding System
(Priority system for FEED after feasibility)

Purpose:
- Join the **three completed bowl sections** (front cone + middle barrel + rear cone)
- Perform circumferential welds between sections

Key characteristics:
- Heavy-duty headstock / tailstock style assembly
- Controlled axial force to close joints
- Robot on linear track performing MIG circumferential welds
- Variable length capability for different bowl sizes

This system is analogous to large cylindrical assembly welding systems.

---

## System B — Helix Insertion & Welding System

Purpose:
- Install and weld the **internal helical blade** into each bowl section

Process:
- Front cone enters → helix inserted → helix welded → exits
- Middle barrel enters → helix inserted → helix welded → exits
- Rear cone enters → helix inserted → helix welded → exits

Each bowl section passes through this system independently.

---

## System C — Clamshell Seam Welding System

Purpose:
- Weld together the two rolled clamshell halves that form each bowl section

Process:
- Front cone clamshell halves positioned → seam welded (2 seams)
- Middle barrel clamshell halves positioned → seam welded (2 seams)
- Rear cone clamshell halves positioned → seam welded (2 seams)

Rotation or repositioning is used to allow full seam access.

---

## Material Flow Rule
All three bowl sections pass through systems in the following order:

1. **System C — Clamshell seam welding**
2. **System B — Helix insertion & welding**
3. **System A — Final assembly circumferential welding**

Material handling systems transfer the three sections between systems.

---

## Feasibility vs FEED Rule
- **Feasibility phase covers ALL THREE systems together** to establish:
  - total plant layout
  - integration
  - throughput
  - risks
- **FEED is executed on ONE system at a time**, selected by the client
- Execution follows FEED approval for that system only

This rule must not be altered in proposals.
