## 1) Bowl Geometry / Dimensional Envelope (Critical)
1. Provide full dimensional drawings for each bowl size:
   - 6.4 m³
   - 7.6 m³
   - 8.3 m³
   - 9.0 m³
2. For each bowl section (front cone / middle / rear cone):
   - OD / ID
   - overall length
   - cone angles
   - seam locations
   - joint design at section interfaces (prep type)
3. Section tolerances:
   - roundness / ovality limits
   - length tolerance
   - interface squareness / runout
4. Total assembled bowl envelope:
   - max length
   - max OD
   - max mass

## 2) Materials & Thickness (Welding Procedure Inputs)
1. Confirm material grade per component/section:
   - SS400 / Rheemalloy / Hardox (or other)
2. Confirm plate thickness per section and per sub-component:
   - clamshell halves
   - interface rings / stiffeners (if any)
   - helix material thickness
3. Confirm any heat treatment or special forming constraints.

## 4) Production Throughput / Scheduling Basis
1. Confirm production target:
   - 5 bowls/day (is this peak or normal?)
2. Confirm shift pattern:
   - 16 hrs/day assumption (true/false)
   - days/week
3. Confirm takt time expectation and WIP strategy:
   - how many bowls can be in-process simultaneously?
4. Confirm changeover expectations between bowl sizes.

---

## 5) Plant Layout / Site Constraints
1. Available floor space and ceiling height.
2. Crane availability:
   - capacity
   - coverage area
   - hook height
3. Material flow constraints:
   - forklift aisles
   - staging zones
   - inbound/outbound logistics
4. Utilities:
   - electrical supply capacity
   - compressed air availability
   - ventilation / fume extraction constraints

---

## 6) Handling / Fixturing Requirements
1. Preferred handling method between cells:
   - trolley
   - chain conveyor
   - AGV
   - crane only
2. Target orientation for welding:
   - vertical seam welding?
   - horizontal orientation?
3. Clamping requirements:
   - allowable deformation / force limits

   - saddles
   - adaptive supports

---

## 7) Helix Component Details
1. Helix geometry per bowl size:
   - pitch
   - length
   - section profile
2. Supply condition:
   - pre-rolled and delivered ready?
   - needs forming onsite?
3. Fit-up tolerances and weld requirements:
   - stitch vs continuous weld
   - access constraints

---

## 8) Automation / Controls Expectations
1. Preferred robot brand (ABB assumed but confirm).
2. PLC / controls standard:
   - Siemens / Allen Bradley / other
3. Integration requirements:
   - MES / production reporting
   - barcode/serial tracking
4. Operator interface requirements:
   - HMI style
   - alarms
   - production metrics

---

## 9) Safety / Compliance
1. Applicable standards:
   - AS4024 / ISO10218
   - electrical standards
2. Required safety performance level (PL / SIL).
3. Required guarding philosophy:
   - fenced cells
   - light curtains
   - scanners
4. Lock-out/tag-out requirements.

---

## 10) Commercial / Governance
1. NDA status:
   - confirmed? signed? required before detailed drawings?
2. Stage-gate approval process:
   - who signs off each gate?
3. Budget expectations per phase:
   - feasibility
   - FEED
   - execution
4. Long-lead procurement authority:
   - when can we place orders?
