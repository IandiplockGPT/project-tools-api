# Mixers Australia — Project Brief (Automation / Welding Plant)

## 1. Objective
Design and deliver an automated welding and assembly system for Mixers Australia concrete mixer bowls/barrels, enabling high-throughput, repeatable, high-quality MIG welding of bowl subassemblies and final bowl assembly.

Target outcome is a scalable manufacturing system capable of producing up to **5 complete mixer bowls per day** (assumed **16 operating hours/day**).

## 2. Background / Context
Mixers Australia manufactures concrete mixer barrels (“bowls”) typically in the size range:
- **6.4 m³**
- **7.6 m³**
- **8.3 m³**
- **9.0 m³**

Barrels are predominantly fabricated from high-tensile / abrasion-resistant steels suitable for harsh continuous-use conditions, including:
- **SS400 high-tensile steel**
- **Rheemalloy (wear resistant)**
- **Hardox**

The system concept is benchmarked against prior heavy-duty robotic circumferential welding systems (internal benchmark reference only).

## 3. Product / Process Overview
Each mixer bowl is fabricated from **three major sections**:
1) **Front cone**
2) **Middle section**
3) **Rear cone**

Each major section is formed from **two rolled clamshell halves**, requiring seam welding.

Each section also requires an internal **helical blade (helix)** to be installed and welded.

Final assembly requires aligning and welding the three major sections together to form the complete bowl.

## 4. Proposed Plant Structure (Stage-Gate Delivery)
The plant is developed as **three distinct but integrated areas**, engineered and delivered using a stage-gate approach.

### Area A — Seam Welding Cell (Clamshell Joining)
Purpose: MIG weld seam joints for each major section (front cone, middle section, rear cone).
- Load two clamshell halves
- Clamp/align
- Robot weld seam 1
- Rotate section
- Robot weld seam 2
- Index part out (trolley / conveyor)
- Repeat for next section type

### Area B — Helix Insertion + Welding Cell
Purpose: Install and weld the internal helical blade into each major section.
- Present section
- Robot picks helix component
- Insert into section
- Weld helix to section
- Index part out

### Area C — Final Assembly & Circumferential Welding System
Purpose: Join the three major sections into one bowl and weld circumferential joints.
Concept:
- Heavy headstock fixture
- Tailstock on track for variable length / pushing sections together
- Robot on long track with MIG welding package travels to weld locations
- Completed bowl removed via overhead crane

## 5. Key Requirements
- **Process:** MIG welding
- **Materials:** SS400 / Rheemalloy / Hardox (final confirmed grade per bowl section required)
- **Throughput:** up to **5 bowls/day**
- High repeatability and quality of welds
- System designed for multiple bowl sizes (6.4–9.0 m³ range minimum)
- Safe operation with industrial guarding, interlocks, and risk controls

## 6. Constraints / Assumptions
### Constraints
- Bowl geometry and dimensions not yet provided (critical input for fixture and track sizing)
- Mixers Australia engineering deliverables (bowl design completion expected mid-Sept)

### Assumptions (to be confirmed)
- Operating window: **16 hours/day**
- Total cycle time available per bowl: ~ **3.2 hrs/bowl**
- Material handling via trolley / chain conveyor + overhead crane for final handling

## 7. Deliverables (Mexx)
Phase-based deliverables, to be confirmed in project plan:
- Overall plant layout & material flow definition
- Concept and feasibility engineering (Area A/B/C integration)
- FEED design per area (layouts, equipment list, interfaces)
- Execution-ready design (detailed mechanical + automation + safety)
- Commissioning plan and handover documentation

## 8. Stakeholders
### Mixers Australia
- Chris Ghassibe (primary contact)
- Craig Shepperson (GM)
- Mandeep Dhillon (Engineer)

### Mexx
- Ian Diplock (Project Director)
- Luis De Jesus
- Keren Stein (Admin)

## 9. Current Status
- Collaboration agreed in principle; Mixers Australia ready to proceed.
- Start targeted end of year / early new year.
- Bowl design completion expected mid-September (Mixers Australia engineering delay).
- NDA status to be confirmed and executed prior to detailed information exchange.

## 10. Next Actions (2–4 weeks)
- Confirm NDA status and execute NDA if required.
- Receive bowl design package (dimensions, thickness, material grades, weld requirements).
- Confirm throughput basis (5 bowls/day), shift pattern, labour model, and takt time assumptions.
- Define preliminary plant layout options (space claim, material flow, crane coverage, safety zones).
- Develop staged project plan and stage-gate review points.

## 11. Risks & Open Questions
### Risks
- Throughput target may require parallel cells or dual-station layout to achieve takt time.
- Material variability (SS400 vs Rheemalloy vs Hardox) may impact weld procedure and consumables.
- Dimensional range may drive fixture complexity and track length requirements.

### Open questions
- Full dimensional envelope for each bowl size (OD, length, cone angles, mass).
- Thickness per section and weld joint design.
- Required QA (NDT type/extent, acceptance criteria).
- Site constraints: available floor space, crane capacity/coverage, power supply, fume extraction.
