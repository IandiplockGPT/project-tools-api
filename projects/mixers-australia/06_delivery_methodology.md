# Mixers Australia — Delivery Methodology (Kerzner / PMBOK Aligned)

> Purpose: Define Mexx delivery approach for proposals and project execution.
> This document explains the staged, risk-managed pathway from concept through execution using an industry-standard stage-gate approach aligned to PMBOK and Kerzner principles.

---

## 1) Delivery Philosophy
Mexx will deliver the Mixers Australia automation program using a structured stage-gate methodology aligned with:
- **PMBOK** (progressive elaboration, integrated change control, phase-gated delivery)
- **Kerzner** (risk reduction through phased commitment, structured approvals, and clear control points)

This approach ensures that early work focuses on **discovery and definition**, while later work focuses on **delivery and execution**, reducing rework and commercial risk.

---

## 2) Program Structure (Three Integrated Areas)
The manufacturing system is structured as three integrated areas:

- **Area A — Clamshell seam welding cell**
- **Area B — Helix insertion + welding cell**
- **Area C — Final assembly + circumferential welding cell (3 sections welded together)**

Although the areas integrate as one plant, best practice is to:
1) define the full plant concept first (big picture), then  
2) execute one area at a time (controlled delivery).

---

## 3) Stage-Gate Approach (Program-Level)
### Stage 1 — Feasibility Study (All Areas A/B/C Together)
**Goal:** establish the full plant concept and confirm technical and commercial viability before detailed design spend.

Mexx will complete feasibility for **all three areas in one integrated feasibility phase** so the client can see:
- total plant flow and integration
- space claim and site implications
- throughput constraints and bottlenecks
- high-level equipment selection
- risks and key decisions
- ROM cost and schedule

This prevents the common failure mode of designing one cell in isolation and later discovering it does not integrate cleanly with upstream/downstream steps.

**Typical Feasibility Outputs**
- Overall plant layout options
- Material flow and handling concept
- Concept-level equipment list (robots, tracks, fixtures, welding packages, extraction)
- Preliminary safety concept (cell zoning, guarding approach)
- Risk register and open questions register
- ROM cost estimate and high-level schedule
- Stage Gate review package

**Stage Gate 1 Decision**
At the end of feasibility, a formal stage-gate review is held to confirm:
- concept viability
- preferred layout option
- priority area for FEED (client chooses)
- readiness to proceed to FEED

---

### Stage 2 — FEED (Front End Engineering Design) (One Area at a Time)
**Goal:** produce sufficient engineering definition to enable confident execution (procurement + build + commissioning) with reduced risk.

After feasibility sign-off, the client selects the **priority area** to advance into FEED. In practice, this will likely be:

- **Area C — Final assembly and welding of the 3 major bowl sections**

FEED is performed on **one area at a time**, allowing:
- controlled budget commitment
- fast-tracking of the most valuable production improvement first
- progressive expansion of the plant as confidence increases

**Typical FEED Outputs**
- refined layout and equipment selection
- equipment duty specifications and interfaces
- preliminary GA drawings and space claim
- fixturing and handling concept design
- control architecture (PLC/HMI/safety)
- long-lead procurement identification
- improved cost and schedule certainty
- readiness review for execution

**Stage Gate 2 Decision**
At the end of FEED, a formal stage-gate review confirms:
- design readiness
- budget approval for execution
- procurement authority
- commissioning plan and acceptance criteria

---

### Stage 3 — Execution (Procurement → Build → Install → Commission)
Once FEED is approved for the selected area, Mexx transitions into execution, including:
- detailed engineering and fabrication drawings
- procurement of equipment and materials
- construction / installation
- testing, commissioning, and handover

This stage is designed to be **delivery-focused**, because feasibility and FEED have already resolved the key unknowns.

**Stage Gate 3 Decision**
Final acceptance and handover is completed after commissioning and client sign-off.

---

## 4) Weekly Design Reviews (Governance)
During feasibility and FEED, Mexx will conduct:
- **weekly design reviews** with the Mexx team
- scheduled design alignment sessions with Mixers Australia as required

These reviews ensure:
- continuous alignment
- early issue detection
- rapid decision-making
- controlled change management

---

## 5) Resourcing Assumptions (Baseline)
### Feasibility Phase
Indicative duration:
- **8 weeks**

Indicative team:
- **4 design engineers** (with drafting support as required), covering:
  - Mechanical engineering
  - Structural engineering
  - Electrical engineering
  - Mechatronics / robotics engineering
  - Draftees as required

### FEED Phase (per Area)
Indicative duration:
- **12 weeks** per selected area (e.g., Area C first)

Team:
- same baseline **4-engineer team** (scalable based on schedule requirements)

> Note: Resourcing can be increased to accelerate delivery depending on client schedule and priority.

---

## 6) Commercial Model
Work is performed on Mexx standard hourly rates and terms, consistent with the Mexx proposal schedule of rates.

This provides flexibility and transparency across:
- feasibility
- FEED
- execution
- commissioning support

---

## 7) Progressive Expansion Plan (Area-by-Area)
After execution and commissioning of the first priority area:
1) Stage Gate review confirms performance and lessons learned
2) client selects the next area for FEED
3) FEED → Execution cycle repeats

This enables:
- early production benefit
- reduced risk
- controlled investment
- continuous improvement

---

## 8) Post-Commissioning Support (Maintenance Contract Option)
After commissioning and handover, Mexx can offer an optional maintenance and support agreement including:
- preventative maintenance schedule
- breakdown support / response SLA
- spare parts recommendations
- software backups and version control
- periodic safety inspection support
- continuous improvement upgrades (optional)

This ensures long-term reliability and protects production throughput.
