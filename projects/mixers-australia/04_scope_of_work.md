# Mixers Australia — Scope of Work (SoW)

> Purpose: Define Mexx scope boundaries, deliverables, and stage-gate structure for the Mixers Australia automated welding plant.
> This SoW supports proposal generation, project control, and change management.

---

## 1) Project Objective
Design and deliver an automated welding and assembly system for concrete mixer bowls/barrels, supporting:
- high repeatability MIG welding
- scalable manufacturing flow
- improved throughput and quality

Target throughput basis: up to **5 bowls/day** (assumed **16 operating hours/day**).

---

## 2) Plant Areas / Work Breakdown
The plant is divided into **three integrated areas**:

### Area A — Seam Welding Cell (Clamshell Joining)
- Join two rolled clamshell halves for:
  - front cone
  - middle section
  - rear cone
- Automated MIG welding of seam joints
- Part rotation between seam welds
- Indexing/handling method (trolley / conveyor) defined during feasibility

### Area B — Helix Insertion + Welding Cell
- Automated placement of internal helical blade into each major section
- Robotic MIG welding of helix to internal surface
- Handling and orientation strategy defined during feasibility

### Area C — Final Assembly + Circumferential Welding System
- Align and close joint faces between:
  - front cone + middle
  - middle + rear cone
- Robotic MIG welding of circumferential joints
- Provision for variable length bowls (multi-size range)
- Crane handling for finished bowl removal

---

## 3) Delivery Methodology
Mexx will deliver the project using a **stage-gate approach** to manage risk and ensure progressive commitment.

### Phase 1 — Feasibility + Overall Plant Layout
**Objective:** Confirm concept viability, define plant architecture, and lock major assumptions before detailed spend.

**Activities:**
- Confirm production targets and takt time assumptions
- Define material flow and cell arrangement
- Preliminary equipment selection and concept layouts
- Define key constraints, risks, and information gaps
- Order-of-magnitude (ROM) budget and schedule

**Deliverables:**
- Plant layout concept(s)
- Process flow diagram (PFD) / manufacturing workflow
- Preliminary equipment list (robots, tracks, positioners, handling)
- Preliminary safety concept (cell zoning, guarding approach)
- Feasibility report with stage-gate recommendation

**Stage Gate 1:** Approve concept + layout + basis of design to proceed to FEED.

---

### Phase 2 — FEED (Front End Engineering Design) — By Area
**Objective:** Develop sufficient engineering definition for cost certainty and execution readiness.

**Activities (per Area A/B/C):**
- Refined layouts and space claim
- Equipment duty specifications and interface definition
- Preliminary mechanical design for fixtures/handling
- Welding system definition (process, WPS assumptions)
- Control system architecture (PLC/HMI, safety PLC)
- Identify long-lead items and procurement plan
- Updated budget and schedule with improved accuracy

**Deliverables:**
- FEED package per area:
  - layout drawings
  - equipment list + specifications
  - interface register
  - preliminary GA drawings
  - control philosophy
  - safety concept and risk review
- Long-lead procurement list
- Updated project schedule

**Stage Gate 2:** Approve FEED for each area to proceed to execution.

---

### Phase 3 — Detailed Engineering, Procurement, Build, Installation & Commissioning
**Objective:** Deliver the plant as an operational production system.

**Activities:**
- Detailed mechanical design and fabrication drawings
- Procurement of robots, welders, tracks, controls, safety systems
- Build and assembly of fixtures and handling systems
- Software development:
  - robot programs
  - PLC code
  - HMI screens
  - safety validation
- Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)
- Site installation
- Site Acceptance Testing (SAT)
- Commissioning and handover

**Deliverables:**
- Full detail design package
- Manufacturing / fabrication drawings
- Electrical schematics and I/O lists
- PLC/HMI software and documentation
- Robot programs and backups
- Safety documentation (risk assessment, validation)
- FAT/SAT reports
- Commissioning and handover pack
- Operator training

**Stage Gate 3:** Handover acceptance.

## 4) Mexx Responsibilities
- Project management (stage-gate governance, reporting)
- Engineering design (mechanical + automation)
- Supplier coordination
- Procurement support (if required)
- Build oversight and quality assurance
- Commissioning and handover support

---

## 5) Client (Mixers Australia) Responsibilities / Inputs Required
- Provide bowl design package (dimensions, thickness, tolerances)
- Confirm material grades and welding requirements
- Confirm production targets and shift patterns
- Provide site layout and constraints
- Provide utilities availability (power/air/extraction)
- Provide crane capacity and coverage details
- Support decision-making at stage gates
- Provide access for surveys, installation and commissioning

---

## 6) Exclusions (Out of Scope Unless Added)
- Civil works / building modifications (unless explicitly included)
- Major structural steel building works
- Ongoing production labour
- Consumables supply (wire/gas/etc.)
- Final QA/NDT services unless specified
- MES/ERP integration unless specified
- Product redesign (bowl geometry changes)

---

## 7) Assumptions
- MIG welding process used as baseline
- Bowl size range: 6.4–9.0 m³ (to be confirmed)
- Throughput basis: up to 5 bowls/day (confirm)
- Operating window: 16 hrs/day (confirm)
- NDA executed before detailed information exchange

---

## 8) Change Control
Any scope changes will be managed via:
- written change request
- impact assessment (cost/schedule/technical)
- approval prior to implementation
