# Mixers Australia — Project Summary (Single Source of Truth)

> Purpose: This file is the primary reference for proposal generation and project communications.
> Client-facing outputs must not include third-party benchmark project names.

## 1) Project Overview
Mixers Australia manufactures concrete mixer bowls/barrels for concrete trucks. Mexx is developing a staged automation solution to increase throughput, consistency, and weld quality in bowl manufacturing using robotic MIG welding.

The automation solution is structured as a plant with **three integrated manufacturing areas**, delivered using an industry-standard **stage-gate** approach (Feasibility → FEED → Execution).

---

## 2) Target Product Range
Standard mixer bowl sizes (most common):
- **6.4 m³**
- **7.6 m³**
- **8.3 m³**
- **9.0 m³**

Note: Final bowl dimensions (OD/length/angles/tolerances) are not yet available and are required to progress detailed engineering.

---

## 3) Materials & Welding
Typical materials (to be confirmed per section and thickness):
- **SS400 high-tensile steel**
- **Rheemalloy (wear resistant)**
- **Hardox**

Welding process:
- **MIG welding**

---

## 4) Throughput Requirement
Target throughput basis:
- Up to **5 complete bowls/day**
- Assumed operating window: **16 hours/day** (confirm)

This throughput requirement strongly influences layout, takt time, and whether parallel cells / multi-station fixtures are required.

---

## 5) Manufacturing Process (Concept)
Each mixer bowl is fabricated from **three major sections**:
1) **Front cone**
2) **Middle section**
3) **Rear cone**

Each major section is formed from **two rolled clamshell halves**, requiring seam welding.

Each section also requires an internal **helical blade (helix)** installed and welded.

Final assembly requires alignment and welding of the three major sections into one complete bowl.

## 6) Plant Structure (Three Integrated Areas)
### Area A — Clamshell Seam Welding Cell
- Join two rolled halves per section (front / middle / rear)
- Robotic MIG weld seam 1
- Rotate section
- Robotic MIG weld seam 2
- Index out via trolley / conveyor (method to be confirmed)

### Area B — Helix Insertion + Welding Cell
- Present section
- Robot inserts pre-rolled helix
- Robotic MIG weld helix into section
- Index out

### Area C — Final Assembly & Circumferential Welding Cell
- Align front + middle + rear sections
- Close joints using controlled fit-up and clamping
- Robotic MIG welding of circumferential joints
- Remove completed bowl via overhead crane

---

## 7) Delivery Approach (Stage-Gate)
### Phase 1 — Feasibility + Overall Plant Layout
- Confirm concept viability and plant material flow
- Define constraints, risks, and assumptions
- ROM cost/schedule

### Phase 2 — FEED (By Area A/B/C)
- Refined layouts
- Equipment specifications and interfaces
- Long-lead item identification
- Improved cost/schedule certainty

### Phase 3 — Execution
- Detailed engineering
- Procurement
- Build, installation
- FAT/SAT
- Commissioning and handover

---

## 9) Current Status
- Mixers Australia has reviewed estimate and confirmed intent to collaborate.
- Likely project start: **end of year / early new year**.
- Mixers Australia bowl design completion expected **mid-September** (engineering delay).
- NDA status to be confirmed.

---

## 10) Next Actions (Immediate)
1. Confirm and execute NDA if required.
2. Receive bowl design package (dimensions, thickness, tolerances, weld joint details).
3. Confirm throughput basis, shift pattern, and takt time expectations.
4. Develop feasibility layout options and material flow.
5. Confirm site constraints: space claim, crane coverage, power, fume extraction.
6. Stage Gate 1 review: approve feasibility basis to proceed to FEED.

## 11) Confidentiality Rule (Hard Constraint)
Client-facing outputs (proposals/emails/reports/presentations) must not mention any third-party benchmark projects or confidential references. Use only neutral wording such as “internal benchmark reference system”.
